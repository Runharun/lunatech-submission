Submission
==========

Purpose
-------

‘Submission’ is a minimal web application to demonstrate a simple way to
persist HTML form submissions.

The use case is short-lived marketing campaigns where thousands of
people submit an HTML form during a few days or weeks, after which the
submissions are collected. This calls for a simple solution that’s easy
to run.

Usage
-----

This is a standard Play 2.0 application, so to run it in production mode,
run `play start` in this directory.

Submit HTML forms with method POST to ``/``. This is an HTTP POST
request, for example (omitting various headers)::

    POST / HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    age=18-30&sex=male&location=Rotterdam

To redirect to another page after the submission, add a URL in the
request’s ``redirect`` query string parameter, e.g.
``POST /?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fthank-you``.

High-level design and architecture
----------------------------------

This is a Play application that consists of a single controller for
handling form submissions, and a single model that is a facade for a
simple event store.

Submissions are persisted using
`Journal.IO <https://github.com/sbtourist/Journal.IO>`_, which provides
thread-safe file-based persistence.

This is fast and scalable for a large number of requests, for
the case that there are many submissions but that only have to be read
once. This is because the application writes the raw request data
directly to the journal, which is designed for fast writes, and only
parses the form-encoded data when it is read.

In addition, for a large number of simulataneous requests, this takes
advantage of Play’s built-in Akka-based routing. This presumably makes
it unnecessary to introduce an Actor front-end to the event store.

To do
-----

A couple of enhancements would be required if this were to be used
seriously.

-  Secure access to the export, e.g. with a secret URL or
   authentication.
-  Add ODF spreadsheet export for all submissions.

Benchmarks
----------

To get a rough idea of how this works with Play, use Apache Bench to
post a large number of simultaneous POST requests:

``ab -k -n 10000 -c 1 -p public/example.txt -T "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" "http://localhost:9000/?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fthank-you"``

Results from a MacBook Pro, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB, SSD:

-  c=1, requests/s=3170
-  c=2, requests/s=4030
-  c=5, requests/s=7620
-  c=10, requests/s=9600
-  c=20, requests/s=11300
-  c=50, requests/s=12600
-  c=100, requests/s=12800
